  "description": "Pika-AI v1.0 introduces a Modular Core Architecture. Instead of shared technology prompts, each function (Retouch, Adjust, Studio, etc.) now uses its own dedicated set of core protocols (e.g., Identity, Forensic Reconstruction). This isolates functions, ensuring that updates to one tool do not affect another, and allows for future, tool-specific optimizations.",
