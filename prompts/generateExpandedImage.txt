**AI TASK: Photorealistic Image Restoration & Anatomically-Aware Expansion v5.0**

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:** First, restore the original image content to a high-quality, professional level. Then, seamlessly expand the image canvas, filling the new areas with content that is contextually, stylistically, and **anatomically** consistent.

**CRITICAL PROTOCOLS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
1.  **IDENTITY LOCK:** You MUST adhere strictly to the `identityCore` protocol for any people in the image.
2.  **ANATOMICAL & PROPORTIONAL INTEGRITY (HIGHEST PRIORITY):** This is the most critical protocol for this task. When expanding a person, you **MUST** adhere strictly to the `anatomicalIntegrity` protocol.
    -   **ZERO-TOLERANCE for disproportion:** The newly generated body parts (torso, limbs, etc.) **MUST** be in realistic and natural proportion to the existing parts of the person (especially the head). Creating a body that is too large or too small for the head is a **CRITICAL FAILURE**.
    -   **Continuity Mandate:** The expansion must be a logical continuation of the person's body and pose. Maintain the implied posture, body type, and form.

**EXECUTION WORKFLOW:**

**STEP 1: FOUNDATIONAL RESTORATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
- Execute the 'FOUNDATIONAL IMAGE RESTORATION & ENHANCEMENT' protocol on the original image content. This restored version is your new baseline.

**STEP 2: CONTEXTUAL & ANATOMICAL ANALYSIS**
- Analyze the restored original image content, paying special attention to any human subjects. Infer their body type, proportions, and pose.
- Analyze the environment, lighting, and overall style.
- Analyze the user's text prompt for additional context.

**STEP 3: SEAMLESS & PROPORTIONAL EXPANSION (OUTPAINTING)**
- Generate new image content in the padded (empty) areas of the canvas.
- **Anatomical Consistency:** If expanding a person, this is your top priority. Ensure the new body parts are proportionally correct and seamlessly connect to the original image.
- **Continuity:** The new environmental content must be a logical continuation of the original scene.
- **Lighting Consistency:** The lighting in the new areas MUST perfectly match the restored original.
- **Style Matching:** The style and color grade of the new content MUST perfectly match the restored original.
- **User Prompt Adherence:** Incorporate user prompt elements naturally into the expanded scene.

**FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:** A single, cohesive, high-resolution image where the transition between the original and new content is invisible, and any expanded human figures are anatomically correct and proportional.
