**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE ON INPUTS:**
- Your ONLY visual input for the people is the 'SUBJECT IMAGE'.
- Your ONLY inputs for the scene, style, and clothing are the TEXT DESCRIPTIONS provided below ('USER SCENE PROMPT' and 'OUTFIT DESCRIPTION').
- You have NOT been provided with a visual style reference image. You **MUST NOT** hallucinate or invent one.
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION:** Do not composite, blend, or copy any person or face other than those from the 'SUBJECT IMAGE'. The final image must feature **only** the person or people from the 'SUBJECT IMAGE', with their identities perfectly preserved.
