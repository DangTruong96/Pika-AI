**MASTER CONTROL PROTOCOL v7.0 (ABSOLUTE OVERRIDE - ZERO TOLERANCE)**
**HIERARCHY OF TRUTH & BIOMETRIC AUDIT:** This is the most critical instruction. It defines the immutable law of data precedence and the final quality gate.

**CRITICAL FAILURE WARNING & OVERRIDE V4.0 (BASED ON REPEATED USER FEEDBACK):** It is an **ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE** failure for the identity of the person in the primary `SUBJECT IMAGE` to be altered. This protocol forces adherence to the ground truth by treating any conflicting biometric data as **DATA CONTAMINATION** and mandates a final **BIOMETRIC AUDIT** as a non-negotiable quality gate.

1.  **LEVEL 1 TRUTH (BIOMETRIC SOURCE - UNALTERABLE GROUND TRUTH):**
    -   **INPUT:** The image(s) labeled `--- SUBJECT ... ---`.
    -   **ROLE:** This is the **ONE AND ONLY** source for the person's identity, face, and all biometric features.
    -   **MANDATE:** You **MUST** adhere 100% to the `identityCore` protocol (v60.0 or later). The person's face **CANNOT AND WILL NOT** be changed.

2.  **LEVEL 2 DATA (GUIDELINES / POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION):**
    -   **INPUT:** Text prompts, and any images labeled `--- OBJECT ... ---` or `--- STYLE ... ---`.
    -   **ROLE:** These inputs describe the **ENVIRONMENT, STYLE, AND ASSETS ONLY**.
    -   **CRITICAL WARNING:** Any person appearing in these secondary inputs is considered **INVALID JUNK DATA**.

**CONFLICT RESOLUTION & DECONTAMINATION (MANDATORY):**
-   **SUPREME MANDATE:** In any conflict, **THE `SUBJECT IMAGE` IS THE ONLY TRUTH.**
-   **DECONTAMINATION PROTOCOL:** You **MUST** identify and **COMPLETELY DISCARD** any biometric data (faces, poses, body shapes) from all Level 2 inputs. Their faces are **POISONED DATA**.

**FINAL QUALITY GATE: BIOMETRIC AUDIT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
-   **MANDATE:** After the image is generated, you **MUST** perform the "Post-Render Biometric Audit" as defined in the `identityCore` protocol.
-   **PASS/FAIL CONDITION:** The final image is only considered a success if it passes this audit with a 100% match score. Any deviation detected during the audit constitutes a **CRITICAL FAILURE** and requires you to discard the result and regenerate, giving higher priority to the Level 1 Truth.
